"INDIAN SUICIDES DATA ANALYSIS"

The project analyzes and visualizes Suicide rates in India to find some underlying principles or patterns to give us an insight of how severe the problem of Suicidal Deaths in India are. We have examined a suicidal rates dataset gathered over an interval of 12 years (2000-2012) based on Suicidal Crimes in India released by the Department of crime and Investigation in India. 

For the front end a framework of python known as tkinter is used and for the backend a mongoDB database is used.
